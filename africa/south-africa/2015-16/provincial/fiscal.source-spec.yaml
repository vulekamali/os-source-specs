      description: This dataset includes expenditure data as published in the
        Estimates of Provincial Revenue and Expenditure. Departmental
        expenditure data in previous financial years have been aligned with the
        budget and programme structures of departments as they are structured in
        the current Medium Term Expenditure Framework. This means that the
        structure of historical expenditure data for a department, may not
        necessarily reflect the same structure of that department when
        expenditure was incurred during a particular financial year. This may be
        due to functions shifts which may have occurred within a particular
        department or a general change in a departmentâ€™s budget programme
        structures (BPS) as departments are afforded an opportunity before the
        start of the Budget to change their BPS.This is to ensure a more
        economical, efficient and effective delivery of public services and
        performance by the department as a whole.
